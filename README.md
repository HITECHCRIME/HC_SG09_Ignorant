Hitech Crime Single 'Ignorant'

**Irma Beat Retnik**

[INTRO]
feeling twisted did the count outside - lost it all 
I assumed a role for you - fuck - what I felt inside 
it crushed my soul - now I know, damn - knew it all along 
basically the fault is mine, I ain't doing what I'm told yeah

[HOOK]
i ain't shouting for the dough - 
wanna throw and catch my flow
all this hiss it ain't in my show
people push me when I'm low 
don't you get it, no forgetting
i am honest, cruising reckless
hive of hornets, truth is worthless
truth is worthless

[CHORUS]
out of their way, out of their way (my way?)
here I come I will shout it in your face
this time ain't gonna be nice
out of their way, out of their way
here I come I will shout it in your face

[VERSE 1]
finding your true self ya, such a though one (blah)
look inside, bring it forth - black double, 
blindful courage, you should run

you're in trouble hun

brushing off pointless needs
dust my shoulders,

think of absolution, 
mindless me has always passed it
for solution with too many problems
now I'm not inclined to solve them (schem)
heed the meaning, spitting hate like poems
just to hide it later - 

if you must 
dim my words I'll be fine

slow down, crush the frown
maybe it's too much for you 
maybe I'm too aggro but I found my crew
lemme tell you the truth in a fair way 
but way too many things you did to me
i've got no single reason to make me sway

Cold elbow through the face

Wanna throw and catch my flow
All this hiss it ain't in my show

Don't you get it, no forgetting (8)

Hive of hornets, truth is worthless (8)
(as a menace) truth is worthless

[CHORUS]
Out of their way, out of their way
Here I come I will shout it in your face
This time ain't gonna be nice
Out of their way, out of their way
Here I come I will shout it in your face

[VERSE 2]
all that wasted thought, easy access, hard flip
down the stairway to the void, you're the cold kind, bitch -
took an ice slip - into precious viral mind, feeding parasites spilling from your sadness aye
you deserve no kindness
let me hear you cry - it's okay now 
at your own request, i will give you no rest 
i will drag you down to hell where your soul belongs -
black heart, black mind, haven't seen the horns
haven't seen the horns ya (haven't seen the horns)
(that's not how you're born)



out of their way, out of their way

[HOOK]
I ain't shouting for the dough - 
Wanna throw and catch my flow
All this hiss it ain't in my show
People push me, when I'm low 
Don't you get it, no forgetting (8)
I am honest, cruising reckless (8)
Hive of hornets, truth is worthless (8)
(as a menace) truth is worthless

[CHORUS]
Out of their way, out of their way
Here I come I will shout it in your face
This time ain't gonna be nice
Out of their way, out of their way
Here I come I will shout it in your face





---
Here I come I will shout it in your face

This time, I ain't gonna be nice 
anymore

(into your precious sadness, feeding parasites lodged in your mind)


BRUTAL HONESTY, DEPRESSION
