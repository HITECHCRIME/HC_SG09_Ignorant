Hitech Crime Single 'Ignorant'

**Irma Beat Retnik**

[CHORUS]
Out of their way, out of their way
Here I come I will shout it in your face
Until you know that you're wrong x2

[VERSE 1] 1:19
feeling twisted did the count outside - lost it all
I assumed a role for you - fuck - what I felt inside 
it crushed my soul - now I know, damn - knew it all along 
basically the fault is mine, I ain't doing what I'm told yeah

[HOOK]
I ain't shouting for the dough - 
Wanna throw and catch my flow
All this hiss it ain't in my show
People push me, when I'm low 

Don't you get it, no forgetting (8)
I am honest, cruising reckless (8)
Hive of hornets, truth is worthless (8)
(as a menace) truth is worthless

[CHORUS]
Out of their way, out of their way
Here I come I will shout it in your face
Until you know that you're wrong x2

Pause

[VERSE 2]
all that wasted thought, easy access, hard flip
down the stairway to the void, you're the cold kind, bitch -
took an ice slip - into precious viral mind, feeding parasites spilling from your sadness aye

you deserve no kindness
let me hear you cry - it's okay now 
at your own request, i will give you no rest 
i will drag you down to hell where your soul belongs -
black heart, black mind, haven't seen the horns
haven't seen the horns ya

(that's not how you're born)

[VERSE 2]
maybe it's too much for you 
maybe I'm too aggro but I found my crew
lemme tell you the truth in a fair way 
but way too many things you did to me
no reason to make me sway
Out of their way, out of their way

[HOOK]
I ain't shouting for the dough - 
Wanna throw and catch my flow
All this hiss it ain't in my show
People push me, when I'm low 

Don't you get it, no forgetting (8)
I am honest, cruising reckless (8)
Hive of hornets, truth is worthless (8)
(as a menace) truth is worthless

[CHORUS]
Out of their way, out of their way
Here I come I will shout it in your face
Until you know that you're wrong x2








Here I come I will shout it in your face

This time, I ain't gonna be nice 
anymore

(into your precious sadness, feeding parasites lodged in your mind)


BRUTAL HONESTY, DEPRESSION
